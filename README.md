# Hysteresis Curve Simulator

A Next.js application to simulate the experiment to draw the Hysteresis (B-H curve) of a magnetic specimen and determine its hysteresis loss.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Adjust parameters like resistance, voltage, and frequency to see real-time effects on the B-H curve.
- **Multiple Materials**: Simulate Soft Iron, Hard Steel, Cast Iron, and Ferrite.
- **Virtual CRO**: Visualizes the magnetic flux density (B) vs. magnetic field intensity (H).
- **Data Recording**: Record observations and calculate energy loss.
- **Educational Content**: Includes Aim, Theory, Procedure, and Results for a complete laboratory experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Mathematics**: [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
