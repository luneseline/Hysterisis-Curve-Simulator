⚠️ SUGGESTIONS - Improvements recommended

To make the codebase look more "human-written," I've identified areas where we can introduce some intentional imperfections and pragmatism. Here are 7 specific, actionable changes:

1. **Remove excessive comments**: In `src/App.tsx`, remove the comments explaining the purpose of each import. Instead, rely on clear variable names and function signatures to convey the intent. (Lines 1-5)
2. **Use more descriptive, yet imperfect variable names**: In `src/features/pages/HomePage.tsx`, rename `data` to `homePageData` and `error` to `loadError`. This adds a touch of human imperfection while maintaining readability. (Lines 20-25)
3. **Introduce a pragmatic shortcut**: In `src/features/simulation/components/SimulationCanvas.tsx`, instead of creating a separate function for calculating the canvas dimensions, inline the calculation directly in the `useEffect` hook. This adds a hint of human decision-making. (Lines 40-45)
4. **Simplify an abstraction**: In `src/features/simulation/logic/physics.ts`, merge the `calculateVelocity` and `calculateAcceleration` functions into a single `updatePhysics` function. This reduces the number of functions and makes the code feel more human-written. (Lines 100-120)
5. **Add a minor inconsistency**: In `src/store/simulationStore.ts`, use a different naming convention for a single variable, such as `simState` instead of `simulationState`. This introduces a minor inconsistency that makes the code feel more human-generated. (Line 50)
6. **Remove an unnecessary type annotation**: In `src/features/simulation/components/ControlPanel.tsx`, remove the type annotation for the `props` object. TypeScript can often infer the types, and this adds a touch of human trust in the compiler. (Line 10)
7. **Use a more human-friendly logging statement**: In `src/features/simulation/logic/physics.ts`, replace the `console.log` statement with a more descriptive `console.warn` statement, such as `console.warn('Physics update failed:', error)`. This adds a hint of human concern for error handling. (Line 150)

By applying these changes, the codebase will start to exhibit characteristics that make it look more "human-written" rather than AI-generated. Remember, the goal is to introduce intentional imperfections that make the code feel more relatable and maintainable.
