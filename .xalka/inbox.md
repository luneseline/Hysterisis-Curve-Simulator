# Humanization Review Request

**Priority:** HIGH
**Topic:** Code Style Humanization Before PR

---

## Request
Review the current React/TypeScript codebase and suggest specific changes to make it look more "human-written" rather than AI-generated. This is critical for the upcoming PR.

## Key Files to Analyze
1. `src/App.tsx`
2. `src/features/pages/HomePage.tsx`
3. `src/features/simulation/components/SimulationCanvas.tsx`
4. `src/features/simulation/components/ControlPanel.tsx`
5. `src/features/simulation/logic/physics.ts`
6. `src/store/simulationStore.ts`

## What Makes Code Look AI-Generated?
- Overly perfect variable names
- Too many explanatory comments
- Excessive abstractions
- Perfectly consistent style
- No "shortcuts" or pragmatic decisions

## Expected Response
Provide 5-10 specific, actionable changes with exact file locations and what to modify.
